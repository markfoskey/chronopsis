This is a simple server-client web app presenting timelines of data scraped from Wikipedia in a unified view. The user can zoom in and out with the mousewheel, and pan by dragging. If you click on one of the entries, the associated Wikipedia article appears in an overlay on the left. Data is currently stored in csv files, and files for British and American novels and historical inventions are included. But it is flexible and extensible. It is under active development.
